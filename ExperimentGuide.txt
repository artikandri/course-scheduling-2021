How to experiment with the project:

1. GA algorithm
    There are 2 kinds of parameters to play with in the GA project. 
    The first set of parameters is located in Data.java. These parameters are:
        boolean isExperimentMode = true or false;
            when enabled, system will access experimental datasets (courses_small, courses_medium, courses_large)
            when disabled, system will access the original dataset (courses.csv)
        int experimentType = 1 or 2 or 3. 
            1 will execute the "courses_small" dataset;
            2 for "courses_medium" dataset;
            and 3 for "courses_large" dataset.
            
    The second set of parameters is located in Scheduler.java. These parameters are: 
        public static final double TARGET_FITNESS = 1.0;
            adjust your desired fitness value. System will stop regenerating schedules 
                when the value is already reached.
        public static final int TARGET_PENALTY = 50;
            adjust your desired penalty value. System will stop regenerating schedules 
                when the value is already reached.
        public static final int TARGET_TIMER_MINUTES = 15;
            adjust your desired fitness value. System will stop regenerating schedules 
                when the value is already reached.


2. PSO algorithm
