How to experiment with the project:

1. GA algorithm
    There are 2 kinds of parameters to play with in the GA project. 
    The first set of parameters is located in Data.java. These parameters are:
        boolean isExperimentMode = true or false;
            when enabled, system will access experimental datasets (courses_small, courses_medium, courses_large)
            when disabled, system will access the original dataset (courses.csv)
        int experimentType = 1 or 2 or 3. 
            1 will execute the "courses_small" dataset;
            2 for "courses_medium" dataset;
            and 3 for "courses_large" dataset.
            When isExperimentMode is set to false, this variable won't be considered.
            
    The second set of parameters is located in Scheduler.java. These parameters are: 
        public static final double TARGET_FITNESS = 1.0;
            Adjust your desired fitness value. System will stop regenerating schedules 
                when the value is already reached. 
                The value should be decimal and ranges from 0 to 1. 
        public static final int TARGET_PENALTY = 50;
            adjust your desired penalty value. System will stop regenerating schedules 
                when the value is already reached. 
                The value should be integer and start from 0. 
        public static final int TARGET_TIMER_MINUTES = 15;
            adjust your desired fitness value. System will stop regenerating schedules 
                when the value is already reached.
                Value should be integer and starts from 0. 
        public static int TARGET_GENERATION = 100000;
            adjust your desired generation value. System will stop regenerating schedules 
                when the value is already reached.
                Value should be integer and starts from 0. 
        public static boolean IS_SCHEDULE_PRINTED_ON_GENERATION = false;
            When set to true, will print schedule on generation. 
                This takes more resources since print is a blocking operation, especially with large schedules.
                By default is set to false. 
        public static boolean IS_GEN_INFO_PRINTED_ON_GENERATION = true;
            When set to true, will print generation info on generation. 
                By default is set to true since generation info is not expensive to generate. 
        public static final int POPULATION_SIZE = 10;
            adjust the number of populations. Value should be integer and starts from 1. 
        public static final double MUTATION_RATE = 0.8;
            adjust the mutation rate. 
            Our experiments show that higher mutation rate is more effective to produce low penalty.
            Value should be decimal and ranges from 0 to 1. 
        public static final double CROSSOVER_RATE = 0.2;
            adjust the crossover rate. 
            Our experiments show that low crossover rate is more effective to produce low penalty value.
            Value should be decimal and ranges from 0 to 1. 
        public static final int NUMB_OF_POPULATION_COMPETITOR = 3;
            adjust the number of populations selected to be competed against each other.
            Value should be integer and starts from 1. 
        public static final int NUMB_OF_TOP_SCHEDULES = 1;
            adjust the number of elite schedules (chosen schedules). 
            Value should be integer and starts from 1. 
        public static int NUMB_OF_LARGE_SIZED_SCHEDULE_CLASSES = 250;
            adjust the number of standard large sized schedule classes. 
            This number will be used by the system to decide whether to encourage 
            the usage of several computationally-heavy functions. 
            Usually the number of classes generated from courses_large.csv will not exceed 250,
            which leads us to decide on this number. 
            Value should be integer and starts from 1. 

        To set the variables, you may go to App.java and check the runGaExperiment function. 
        To set the parameters located in Data.java, 
            you may include the parameters inside the function to run the algorithm.
        gaScheduler.runAlgorithm(true, 1);
            > IS_EXPERIMENT_MODE: true
            > EXPERIMENT_TYPE: 1
            will run the ga algorithm in experiment mode on courses_small.csv dataset

        To set the parameters located in Scheduler.java,    
            you may set each parameter directly before calling the method to run the algorithm, 
            since all of the parameters in this class are in static mode. 
        Scheduler.TARGET_TIMER_MINUTES = 10;
            will set the targeted timer (in minutes) as 10 mins. 
        Scheduler.TARGET_PENALTY = 10;
            will set the targeted penalty value as 10. 


2. PSO algorithm
All adjustable parameters are accessible in App.java (located in package com.course_scheduling.app, the path directory is src\main\java\com\course_scheduling\app\App.java).

the function to call is app.runPsoAlgorithm(String datasetSize, String psoMode, int psoLimit, int psoParticles, int psoTimeLimit)

example :
	app.runPsoAlgorithm("small", "limitFV", 100, 10, 10);
	app.runPsoAlgorithm("medium", "limitIter", 5000, 10, 15);

Parameters:
	1. datasetSize :
		possible values are "small", "medium", "large", "default".
		"small" will use the course_small.csv dataset (1 group, 13 courses)
		"medium" will use the course_medium.csv dataset (4 groups, 52 courses)
		"large" will use the course_large.csv dataset (8 groups, 104 courses)
		any other value will use courses.csv dataset (50 groups, 650 courses)
	2. psoMode:
		possible values are "limitFV" and "limitIter"
		"limitFV" will stop the iterations when the global best penalty is lower than the specified psoLimit, or when the execution time exceeds psoTimeLimit.
		"limitIter" will stop the iterations when the iterations reaches the specified psoLimit, or when the execution time exceeds psoTimeLimit.
	3. psoLimit:
		the max penalty score for operation mode "limitFV", or
		the max iteration for operation mode "limitIter"
		recommendations:
		"limitFV" ... for datasetSize="small", psoLimit is recommended to be 650. no recommendations for "medium", "large", and "default".
		"limiIter" ... psoLimit is recommended to be 1000.
	4. psoParticles:
		the number of particles to be used. recommended is 10.
	5. psoTimeLimit
		the hard time limit for the algorithm to run (in minutes).
		once the algorithm runs for t minutes, where t >= psoTimeLimit, the algorithm will stop running.
		recommended to be 10 or 15 minutes.

* Important!
When running App.java, it is advised to run only one algorithm for one experiment at a time, 
to avoid Netbeans running out of resources. Alternatively, the algorithms may be run consecutively, 
but with a delay of 10s between each generation. 

* Comparing FV Values
Since FV is calculated by the formula (1/sum_of_penalty), we want to maximize the FV. 
Greater FV mean better quality of the result.
