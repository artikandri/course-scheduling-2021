How to experiment with the project:

1. GA algorithm
    There are 2 kinds of parameters to play with in the GA project. 
    The first set of parameters is located in Data.java. These parameters are:
        boolean isExperimentMode = true or false;
            when enabled, system will access experimental datasets (courses_small, courses_medium, courses_large)
            when disabled, system will access the original dataset (courses.csv)
        int experimentType = 1 or 2 or 3. 
            1 will execute the "courses_small" dataset;
            2 for "courses_medium" dataset;
            and 3 for "courses_large" dataset.
            
    The second set of parameters is located in Scheduler.java. These parameters are: 
        public static final double TARGET_FITNESS = 1.0;
            adjust your desired fitness value. System will stop regenerating schedules 
                when the value is already reached.
        public static final int TARGET_PENALTY = 50;
            adjust your desired penalty value. System will stop regenerating schedules 
                when the value is already reached.
        public static final int TARGET_TIMER_MINUTES = 15;
            adjust your desired fitness value. System will stop regenerating schedules 
                when the value is already reached.
        public static final int POPULATION_SIZE = 10;
            adjust the number of populations
        public static final double MUTATION_RATE = 0.8;
            adjust the mutation rate. Our experiments show that higher mutation rate is more effective to produce low penalty
        public static final double CROSSOVER_RATE = 0.2;
            adjust the crossover rate. Our experiments show that low crossover rate is more effective to produce low penalty
        public static final int TOURNAMENT_SELECTION_SIZE = 3;
            adjust the number of populations selected to be competed
        public static final int NUMB_OF_ELITE_SCHEDULES = 1;
            adjust the number of elite schedules
