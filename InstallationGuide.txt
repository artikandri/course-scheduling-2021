Environment installation: 

1. Install OpenJDK 11
    - Linux: 
        https://dev.to/mumu/windows-subsystem-for-linux-java-setup-2b2b?utm_source=pocket_mylist 
        > sudo apt update
        > sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
    - Windows: 
        https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Aleph/Knowledge_Articles/How_to_Download_and_Install_OpenJDK_11_on_Windows_10_PC_for_Aleph 

2. Find out where JDK is installed.
    - Linux:    
        > readlink -f $(which java)
        will output something similar to: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java

3. Setup your environment variable and configure the PATH env variable
    - Linux: 
        > nano ~/.bashrc  OR vi ~/.bashrc  as ROOT user
            will enable you to edit .bashrc file. 
            Add this line to the end of the  file to add the JAVA_HOME variable to your env: 
            export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk/excluding/the/bin/folder
            Example: 
            export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
        > source ~/.bashrc
            refresh the change in the terminal
    - Windows:             

4. Verify whether Java is installed already. 
    > java --version

5. Install maven. Maven is a build tool that you can use for compiling, running unit or integration tests, 
    deploying you your code locally and remotely, etc. 
    Linux: 
    > sudo apt install maven 

6. Verify whether maven is already installed. 
    Linux: 
    > mvn --version

7. Build and run the project 
    > mvn compile -e
        will compile the project and show errors in case it fails
    > mvn clean package
        will build a clean package in the "target" folder in form of "jar" file
    > javac /path/to/your/file.java -cp /path/to/your/jar/dependency/file
        will compile a specific file with given dependencies
    > javac /path/to/your/file -cp /path/to/your/jar/dependency/file
        will run the file with given dependencies. RUN THIS COMMAND FROM src/.../java folder, or else it won't work 
    > java -jar {jar_file_name}.jar
        will run the compiled file d
    > mvn install -e
        download & install dependencies defined in pom.xml
    > mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -DskipTests=true clean install
        clean install maven 
    > mvn dependency:copy-dependencies
        copy dependencies from M2_HOME folder (in Linux, usually located in /home/user_name/.m2/repository) to target/dependency folder
        
8. Alternative: Install NetBeans as your IDE. It runs much faster than iDEA on low to mid-end computer 
    > Windows: 
        https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb126/nb126.html 
        > WSL2 configuration: 
            To use NetBeans with WSL, you have to allow Windows to use UNC path ("//wsl..."). To do this, you may 
            add a registry key to disable UNC check.
            https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/disableunccheck-registry-key-created-during-rational-synergy-installation 
            - go to Registry Editor under 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE'
            - find "\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor\" path  
            - add 'DisableUNCCheck' key, value=1, hexadecimal 
            - rerun the project (Shift + F6)
