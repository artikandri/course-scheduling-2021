Proposed steps: 

1. Extract schedule into separate, readable txt file(s)
2. Transform the schedule into chromosome for GA algorithm
3. Transform the schedule into  particle for PSO algorithm
4. Implement the GA algorithm
5. Implement the PSO algorithm
6. Run both algorithms
7. Calculate fitness function on both algorithms
8. Measure running time of both algorithms
9. Compare fitness value and running time
10. Display the result and comparison values
