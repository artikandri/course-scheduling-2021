# course-scheduling-2021

Final project for Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence class, 1st semester in Politechnika Wroc≈Çawska, Fall 2021.
The idea was to build an optimal course schedule with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. 

Datasets were acquired from 2 sources:
1. Unitime
   Our main reference. Chosen file: LLR: Large Lecture Room Problem dataset, Fall 2007 (pu-fal07-llr)
   Processed into 4 separate datasets: courses.csv, instructors.csv, rooms.csv, timeslots.csv
   Column mappings are explained in each corresponding script.
